I'm on a quest. I'm always on a quest. A challenge or a dare, even, really.

It started in 2015 when I read Jim Grey's piece [Software Technical Writing is a Dying Career (But Here's What Writers Can Do to Stay in the Software Game)](https://softwaresaltmines.com/2015/06/16/software-technical-writing-dying/). I wasn't sure then, and am not sure now, that I entirely agree with the thesis of the post. Whether the thesis is true or not, I really appreciated the career paths that Jim maps out. Those were gold. They still are.

Since 2015, I've felt increasingly confident in my tech writing game. It's been a good career and I've learned a lot. In that time, I've also seen how strongly motivated I am by *learning* as such. I also have seen that I really like problem solving, bringing ideas and people together, and planning and organizing projects. Working at some startups, I got some experiences unusual for many technical writers: I've gotten to sit with customers and prospects, work closely with customer support, and watch people use my documentation and our products. I got to work as a product owner to help fill in a staffing gap. In these experiences, I found that I really like working with customers.

Slowly, I've gotten into Jim's idea that technical writers can morph into product managers. It makes sense, really. Product managers must first and foremost empathize with users. So must technical writers. Product managers must communicate clearly with multiple parties: users, developers, and leadership. So must technical writers. Product managers must understand a product not only from the inside, but also from the outside. So must technical writers.

I admit that some tech writers focus more on the innards of a software product and some more on the user-facing dimension. I started technical writing about the user experience though, how to use an application. From there, I've moved onto documenting the innards: how it's built and how external developers can interface with it. So I figure I've got both bases covered.

We'll see if it works.
