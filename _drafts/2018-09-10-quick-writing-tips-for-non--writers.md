*tl;dr*: Lots of times our writing comes out of our desires and fears. Most of being a good writer is about writing _to an audience_ rather than _from ourselves_.

# Pick an audience

When you write, know to whom you are writing. For instance, as a developer documentation person, I am usually writing to developers. I also have to keep in mind that many others will pass by and peek into my writing. These people are likely to see docs near the surface of a website or at its landing page. When I write these pages, I write less technically, while directing more technical people to go deeper into the site for specialized knowledge.

Picking an audience means identifying:

* likely or required background knowledge
* assumptions shared with the reader
* the reader's level of skill in the language you use

Identifying these factors upfront and explicitly usually improves writing dramatically.

# Plan ahead

When you code anything larger than a simple script, you probably plan ahead. Once, in college, I wrote a ten-pager. I was comfortable writing ten-pagers. No big deal, really. As I reread this one, though, I was horrified. My conclusion was the exact contrary of my thesis. I had disproved myself gleefully, innocent as Adam.

That never would have happened with an outline.

Likewise, outlines curb rambling thoughts and stray sentences. When I outline, I cover all my bases and forget nothing that I had meant to include.

It might just be me, but I am so fanatical about outlining before writing that I even outline emails. Really, if I have to write anything more than a few sentences, I start by identifying bullet points to cover.

# Small is beautiful

Use smaller and fewer words whenever they'll do. Shorter sentences are easier to understand than longer sentences. So are shorter phrases. Use fewer words if you can manage, and write in the active voice. For example, "I made mistakes," rather than, "Mistakes were made," which is harder for our brains to process and muddles the agency of the subject.

At the very least, make your language fit your audience. Do not use words you cannot expect your audience to understand. In particular, jargon is deadly. Don't get me wrong. Jargon is great shortform and very helpful for communicating with other specialists or insiders. But nothing is worse than jargon for communicating outward.

Whether the average person should be able to read difficult writing isn't the point. The point is that you have information you want to convey. Make it easy on people and they're more likely to pay attention and get it. You're not writing the great American novel. It's just an email. And it's just that simple.

# Get editing or coaching

Even great editors need editors. It's just a fact. Other people don't see things the way we do. As a result, they are better suited to see how other people, who are not us, will see and understand our work. They are not only a fresh pair of eyes, but also an objective response.

We're used to thinking that writing quality is subjective. This is utter bullshit. Writing is like code. Writing is good to the degree that it conveys what is in my brain to your brain. If my intended audience does not understand my writing, then I have failed and my writing sucks. It's that simple and that objective.

Baseball players, ballerinas, electricians, carpenters, hula dancers: what they all have in common with writers is that if they want to get better they will get coaching and mentorship. With respect to writing, I have found it helpful getting quick or immediate feedback from teachers who went over their markups with me. There are also online apps that can identify common problems and point them out to you.
