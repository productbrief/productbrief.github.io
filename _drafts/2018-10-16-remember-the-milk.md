*tl;dr*: I love Remember the Milk. If you want a simple to-do list, this app is for you. If you want something that can grow with you as your life needs more organization, this app is for you. If you want a simple UI, this app is for you. If you want plugins, integrations, and APIs, this app is for you.

# the product:

Remember the Milk (RTM) is not new. I've been using it since my previous favorite to-do app was deprecrated in 2013. Since then, I've gone from a few simple lists to a full-blown Getting Things Done (GTD) implementation, and RTM has been with me every step of the way.

At its core, RTM is a to-do list app. Its power lies in its features, most of which the user can take or leave. RTM has a web app, mobile apps for both Android and iOS that appear to be native, and a desktop app that looks to me to be made with ElectronJS. The Android mobile app offers almost the entire set of functionality but with one or two features possibly excluded. Its web app has an older UI as well as a more modern, less click-heavy one.

We'll be looking at the desktop app, which offers access to all features and seems to be the same across platforms except for OS-specific UI elements.

Features include:

* tasks and lists
* smart lists. These smart lists are much like the smart lists in iTunes. The lists automatically update to include or exclude tasks based on search criteria that you set.
* tags for adding additional categories to a task
* the ability to sort tasks by task name, priority, or due date. You can also drag and drop tasks into the order you need.
* the ability to create sort methods if the default methods aren't enough. Custom sorts let you sort by one or more attributes of a task however you like.
* searching for tasks using text and attributes of the task
* contacts for sharing tasks with other users
* locations for reminding you when you get near the place relevant to a task
* subtasks and notes for each task
* attributes for tasks including start time, due date, URL, estimates, reminders, and more
* task attachments from (at least) Dropbox and Google Drive

All of the above is free. That means that you can get to be a reasonably powerful power user without paying a dime. For a modest subscription, you can also get:

* instant syncing that really is instant
* widgets (for the Android version)
* hotkey task creation in Mac, like Spotlight Search or Alfred

Remember the Milk [integrates with a number of other products](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/integrations/), including:

* Gmail and Google Calendar - sidebar widgets
* Alexa and Siri
* Evernote
* create tasks via email and Twitter (!)
* RSS output so you can get tasks fed to your RSS feed reader when they come due (!)
* IFTTT - for instance, I have an integration that, any time I add the tag `chore` to a task, creates a calendar entry in my Google calendar blocking off time in the evening for me to do the task. I also integrate with Google Home via IFTTT to create tasks by voice. I use the phrase, _OK, Google. Create a task:_ followed by the text of the task, e.g., _caulk bathroom_. This integration creates a task and drops it in your RTM inbox. Your RTM inbox is the list to which RTM adds uncategorized tasks.

The list above begins to hint at the possible nerdery involved in RTM. If that wasn't enough, RTM provides an API. I haven't played with it yet. It looks like there could be issues using it in production, but for nerding out, it looks pretty sufficient.

Though the UI is not customizable, the whole task-management underlying RTM is pretty configurable.
