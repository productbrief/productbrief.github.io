*tl;dr*: I get complimented on my Jira tickets a lot. All I do is write them like I would write good user documentation.

# Principles of Technical Writing

There are a lot of ways you can slice and dice the things that make for good user or developer documentation. For present purposes, I don't think there's really a checklist, but there is a rubric we can use. Here's the rubric that I have developed and that I call the Four Cs. Good technical writing, good tickets, and good user stories are:

- Correct
- Complete
- Concise
- Clear

We'll look at each one briefly in turn. We'll look a made-up user story 

# Correct

The worst possible thing for your writing is that it might be incorrect, especially by way of being contrafactual. Writing something that is known by a readers to be false will quickly destroy your credibility with your readership - in this case, your development team members.

Aside from being flatly incorrect, the words you choose may be too general or too specific to match the precise meaning that you intend.

I've seen a lot of user stories that start, _As a user..._ These make me cringe. In some cases, the product team has already decided on a very exact user. But otherwise, some further description is really important. You don't have to go overboard. But even a single adjective can help other team members contextualize the rest of the story.

- _As a new user..._
- _As a registered but inexperienced user..._
- _As an AcmeSoft enterprise administrator..._

Making sure that you are writing the right thing will go a long way to making sure your reader reads the right thing.

# Complete

When I was a beginning technical writer, I would get frustrated if people couldn't find answers to their questions in my documentation and then came to me. I would grunt under my breath something like "RTFM".
