My background is technical writing. I help companies document, support, market, sell, and improve their APIs and SDKs. My docs and code samples help software developers quickly understand and use of APIs. I help market and sell producrs. I work for Blackboard, Inc.

I've led high-value projects like:

* migrating content from cloud provider to a platform I designed and managed to improve SEO and editorial experience (project lead)
* creating a web components library for use in revamping our product's UI (product owner)
* producing a video compilation of interviews of coworkers for public consumption (line producer)

Current projects include:

* drafting an API design standards document to unify diverse API roadmaps
* reorganizing developer content created by diverse team members into a unified whole
* writing quick-start guides to help developers launch into our APIs

In my next career move, I will be a product manager. I want to focus on technical products like APIs or products that focus on content like CMSes.
